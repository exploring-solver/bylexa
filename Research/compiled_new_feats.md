Feature List:
Distributed Computing with Sockets:

Use socket connections to distribute code and tasks across multiple clients (PCs or devices).
Allow the server to distribute computational tasks to connected clients, and have the clients return results.
Integrate this distributed model to run complex computations (e.g., large datasets, simulations) across multiple machines.
Automated Project Setup:

Automate the creation of folder structures, write initial code files, and set up a project environment.
Integrate with AI-based code generation (like OpenAI) to create basic code templates.
Automated Task Management:

Allow for distributing computational tasks in parallel across clients using threading or multiprocessing.
Implement task queues for load balancing between connected clients.
Remote Task Execution:

Clients execute the code remotely after receiving it from the server.
Collect and aggregate the results on the server.
Code and Resource Sharing:

Implement code sharing between clients and servers using sockets.
Use a server-client model to send Python code (or serialized functions) to clients for execution.
Git Integration and Pipeline Automation:

Automate Git actions, including commit, push, and running pipelines using gitpython or subprocess.
Automatically push generated or computed results to a remote Git repository.
Automation of Commands and Tools:

Use Python to run shell commands for opening and interacting with tools like VS Code, terminal operations, etc.
Approach:
1. Distributed Computing with Sockets
Server:
Set up a server to listen for multiple client connections over a socket.
Distribute code (e.g., functions) or data for computation to clients.
Receive computed results back from clients.
Clients:
Each client connects to the server.
Receive the code or task from the server.
Execute the task using their local resources and return the results.
2. Automation of Project Setup
Use os and pathlib to automatically create a folder structure based on predefined templates.
Use AI-based tools like OpenAI's API to generate code and write it into specific files using file handling functions in Python.
3. Parallel Task Execution
Utilize threading or multiprocessing to allow the server to handle multiple clients at once, distributing tasks evenly and efficiently.
Use libraries like concurrent.futures or custom threading to manage simultaneous task execution.
4. Remote Execution and Resource Sharing
Clients will execute code or computations as tasks, received through the socket.
Implement error handling to ensure if a client fails, the task is re-distributed to another client.
5. Automating Git Commands
Integrate gitpython to automate the process of committing and pushing code.
Use Python scripts to trigger CI/CD pipelines after code is pushed.
6. Automation of System Commands
Use subprocess or os to run terminal commands from Python. This can include starting tools like VS Code, running shell scripts, or interacting with other system services.
Required Libraries:
Socket Programming:

socket: For creating the server-client connection.
Task Execution:

concurrent.futures, multiprocessing: For parallel execution and managing multiple client connections.
File and Project Setup:

os, pathlib: For creating directory structures, handling files, and writing code to files.
AI Code Generation:

openai: For generating code dynamically using GPT models.
Git Automation:

gitpython: For automating Git commands like commit, push, and clone.
subprocess: For running system-level commands (e.g., opening VS Code).
Task Scheduling:

APScheduler: For scheduling tasks to run at specific times or intervals.
Example Flow:
Server Start:

Start the server and listen for connections from clients.
When a client connects, the server assigns a task (a chunk of code) to be executed.
Client Execution:

The client receives the code, runs it, and sends back the result.
The server aggregates all results from the clients.
Automated Git Push:

Once all computations are complete, the server commits the results or generated code to a remote Git repository.
Distributed Execution:

Each connected client shares its computing resources to process part of the task.
The server ensures load balancing and handles failure or retries if any client disconnects or fails.
By incorporating this approach into your project, you can efficiently distribute computational tasks across multiple devices and automate various stages of code generation, project setup, and execution.
